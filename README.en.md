AstroArabia is an open-source, Arabic-first RTL Astro theme starter for the Saudi and wider Arabic technical community. It gives teams a fast, clear path to launch company sites, digital products, portfolios, and campaign pages with native RTL support and minimal client-side JavaScript.

## Highlights

- Built with Astro for fast, static-first output.
- Integrated with Tailwind CSS v4 and a centralized color, spacing, and typography system.
- RTL-first layouts, logical spacing, and direction-aware interactions.
- Dark mode powered by the Tailwind `dark:` variant, with visitor preference persisted locally.
- SEO-ready defaults including canonical URLs, Open Graph metadata, and generated sitemaps.
- Five production-ready routes: agency, SaaS, documentation, portfolio, and landing page.
- Reusable CVA-powered UI primitives for buttons and cards.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm create astro@latest -- --template almahers/astroarabia
```

Then install dependencies and start the local server:

```bash
cd astroarabia
npm install
npm run dev
```

This project requires Node.js `22.12.0` or later and npm `9.6.5` or later. Use an even-numbered or LTS Node.js release.

## Brand and Theme Customization

Start with `tailwind.config.mjs` to update the color, font, and spacing utilities used by components. Matching theme tokens also live in `src/styles/global.css` under `@theme`, so update both locations when changing the template identity. The project ships IBM Plex Sans Arabic locally for body text and Alexandria for headings.

## Template Settings

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`, then set `PUBLIC_WHATSAPP_NUMBER` to your project’s WhatsApp number using digits only and without the `+` prefix. The bundled number is intentionally a placeholder so the template never points to a personal number.

The quote form is a ready-to-customize interface only: it does not submit data and does not require a particular provider. Connect it to the approach that suits your project, such as Cloudflare Pages Functions, a Worker, or an external form provider, with appropriate validation and protection.
